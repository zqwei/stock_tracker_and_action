# AGENTS.override.md (optional)
Use this file to temporarily override `AGENTS.md` for experiments.

Example uses:
- Force a specific DB choice (SQLite vs DuckDB)
- Force a specific provider implementation
- Add a short-term development rule (e.g., "focus only on import + P&L this week")

Delete this file when the experiment is done.
